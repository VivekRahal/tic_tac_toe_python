# tic_tac_toe_python
This is my first flask API for a python tic-tac-toe game.
Using the POST method, Postman is used to communicate data to a server.
We provide players' names and symbol data first, followed by player symbol, row, and column position until the game is over or a winner is found.
This is how we use Postman to send details in json:

STEP:1

http://192.168.29.240:3000/details

{
    "player1":"vivek"
    "symbol1":"x",
    "player2":"karan",
    "symbol2":"o"
}


if status is 200 ok then.ðŸ†—


STEP:2



http://192.168.29.240:3000/play


{
    "symbol":"x",
    "row":2,
    "column":1
}


if symbol and position entered are correct then staus will be 200 okðŸ†— and again send json format with different positons untill the game drawn or finds the winner.
